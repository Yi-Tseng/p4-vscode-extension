## Open source projects used in this extension
- [Antlr (ANother Tool for Language Recognition)](https://www.antlr.org) is a
 powerful parser generator for reading, processing, executing or translating
 structured text or binary files. To this end, the referenced lex/yacc P4
 grammars
 (links to:
 [lexer](https://github.com/p4lang/p4c/blob/master/frontends/parsers/p4/p4lexer.ll)
 and
 [parser](https://github.com/p4lang/p4c/blob/master/frontends/parsers/p4/p4parser.ypp))
 have been transferred to Antlr4 syntax in [grammar](grammar) folder.

- [vscode-p4](https://bitbucket.org/shouxi/vscode-p4/src/master/) "the most basic
